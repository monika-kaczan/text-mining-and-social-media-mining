United States,true,326,B07ZPKBL9V,3.00,Item shipped quickly and securely! Physically the phone is in excellent condition with no significant wear and tear. The biggest issue we've encountered is that out of the box one of the bottom speakers just didn't work at all. Absolutely no sound comes out of the left side but that wasn't a deal breaker as the phone was mostly wanted as an upgrade to storage capacity. The battery life has also left something to be desired as right after set up the phone alerted to the battery health being 'significantly degraded' and the phone loses charge way too quickly throughout the day. In the time since the phone has been in use the ear speaker seems to have gone out making it so phone calls need to be made with headphones or on speakerphone as the ear speaker sounds muffled and distant,Leaves a little to be desired,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DMI3LFZA82ZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

United States,true,1203,B07ZPKBL9V,1.00,Update: After several days of back and forth with the seller refusing to replace the device I finally had to call Amazon Customer service to have them issue a return label because the seller refused to do anything to make it right.BUYER BEWARE!!!My moms old iPhone 6S is dying and she desperately needed a new phone and can’t afford to buy one.She does a lot for us like watching our kids during the week while we are at work and we wanted to bless her with a “new” phone.I contacted the seller in advance to make sure it would arrive in time for her birthday party.I placed the order last week and the item arrived today. As soon as I picked it up from FEDEX and got it back in my office to test it out I immediately noticed light coming from the right side of the phone. There is a huge gap between the display and the frame. You can fit a penny between them.The display itself is not cracked and the packaging is just fine so it didn’t happen in transit and was sent to us in this condition.Nobody checked the device before it was shipped out because it’s immediately obvious when you pick it up to use it.Her birthday party is on Friday and here we are on Wednesday with a broken phone.We called Amazon and they said the seller has until next Monday to reply to our request for a replacement. Hopefully we hear from them before then with a resolution.We are really sad because she deserves something nice and now we are waiting on the seller to make it right.,Broken. It was supposed to be a B-Day gift for my mom and now she doesn’t get a gift on her Bday,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FSXURCF3VS36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

United States,true,1476,B07ZPKBL9V,4.00,Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone can’t expect perfect condition that’s why I’m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone can’t really see  but since I applied a screen protector can’t see it at all ??. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also can’t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but let’s see how that goes . I’m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and it’s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyone’s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .,Works great.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F8QU5OCZRG4N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

United States,true,3170,B07ZPKBL9V,2.00,Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact,,

United States,true,3679,B07ZPKBL9V,1.00,Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON!

Prr rt onlem is now they don’t have anymore … at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon’s renew store.

United States,true,4755,B07ZPKBL9V,5.00,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.,Great Savings Good Value,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R5QY4OOZKV9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

Does not freeze. Even the Apple symbol works to add a setting tool to use when you need an easy double and triple tap access.

It is not easy ordering electronic devices from businesses when we cannot see it touch the item on hand but WHEW!

United States,true,2031,B07ZPKBL9V,1.00,Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.,Absolute Scam.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PIHJI50ASVVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

United States,true,1882,B07ZPKBL9V,1.00,Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,Don’t trust Tech Exchange!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25AUXMC7D0LBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKBL9V

United States,true,7,B07ZPKR714,4.00,I got the phone yesterday and came earlier than expected date. So far it works very well,,
United States,true,8,B07ZPKR714,4.00,I bought this phone for my mom. The phone is in very good condition with 93% Battery life. One tiny scratch at the back but that’s not important. I would’ve gave 5 stars but the charger isn’t working. I have extra chargers so I won’t complain much. But those who are new to iPhones,,
United States,true,9,B07ZPKR714,5.00,Just got it today! The set up and everything only took an hour or so,,
United States,true,10,B07ZPKR714,4.00,I just got the phone today but so far it’s pretty good. The battery line is at 96% max capacity. I got a notification about something not being a genuine apple part but it’s working fine so far. The screen probably been replaced and that may be what’s triggering it. There were two scratches on the side but that’s easy to hide with a case. The phone also comes with a screen protector and an off brand iphone charger.,Pretty good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F6561SVRIEZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714
United States,true,21,B07ZPKR714,4.00,I got the phone in some what good condition until 4 days later I noticed a crack in the screen that runs from the middle down to the bottom. They hid it real well by polishing the screen. Beware ! About buying a renewed iPhone. About performance and battery life no problem phone works well in that department. But be aware of the cosmetics and condition of these used phones.,Not bad considering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13ZS97OOE6R3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714
United States,true,22,B07ZPKR714,5.00,I ordered 2 of these for my 11 and 12 year old nieces.. The first phone had 94% battery life and couldn't tell was used at all. So i went ahead  ordered the 2nd one once i saw that the first phone was good. The 2nd one had 87%  life which was ok for a used phone . But the screen on the 2nd one was lifted from the phone. I could tell it hd been replaced. So we ordered an otterbox for that one. If she drop that phone the screen would crack I believe even with a screen protector because its not down like it should be.. Other than that I'm ok.  Will buy from them again.. Fast shipping time..,Good for a used phone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK8I90W7MDC2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714

United States,true,24,B07ZPKR714,4.00,Ordered last night and came today,,

Nothing a phone case can’t cover up. Battery life at 83%. Considering the price and “good condition” description I didn’t expect anything different.

I took it to Verizon to have my old phone removed from our family plan and this one added. They also updated my sim card since mine was dated. Total charge was about $40. Staff were incredibly patient and helpful making sure everything was working as it should before I left. Verizon staff were impressed that this was a refurbished phone because it looked brand new to them. As with most things in life,,

I thought nothing of it. 3 months later the phone display begins to go blank. I contact customer's service. I was told to send the phone back. My situation didn't allow me to do that cause I'm in a different country from the states. Anyways I found a temporary solution. Now I currently can't use my face ID.

But we can mail that back to them and then wait for a replacement to come back which will leave my son without a phone for approximately a week or more.

United States,true,1657,B07ZPKR714,2.00,Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact,,

After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent.

And because it was reported stolen apples system does not allow the phone to be activated through a phone career until the phone is retuned to the original owner.

After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon’s renew store.

United States,true,231,B07ZPKR714,3.00,Item shipped quickly and securely! Physically the phone is in excellent condition with no significant wear and tear. The biggest issue we've encountered is that out of the box one of the bottom speakers just didn't work at all. Absolutely no sound comes out of the left side but that wasn't a deal breaker as the phone was mostly wanted as an upgrade to storage capacity. The battery life has also left something to be desired as right after set up the phone alerted to the battery health being 'significantly degraded' and the phone loses charge way too quickly throughout the day. In the time since the phone has been in use the ear speaker seems to have gone out making it so phone calls need to be made with headphones or on speakerphone as the ear speaker sounds muffled and distant,Leaves a little to be desired,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DMI3LFZA82ZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714

United States,true,1891,B07ZPKR714,1.00,Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,Don’t trust Tech Exchange!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25AUXMC7D0LBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714

United States,true,802,B07ZPKR714,1.00,Update: After several days of back and forth with the seller refusing to replace the device I finally had to call Amazon Customer service to have them issue a return label because the seller refused to do anything to make it right.BUYER BEWARE!!!My moms old iPhone 6S is dying and she desperately needed a new phone and can’t afford to buy one.She does a lot for us like watching our kids during the week while we are at work and we wanted to bless her with a “new” phone.I contacted the seller in advance to make sure it would arrive in time for her birthday party.I placed the order last week and the item arrived today. As soon as I picked it up from FEDEX and got it back in my office to test it out I immediately noticed light coming from the right side of the phone. There is a huge gap between the display and the frame. You can fit a penny between them.The display itself is not cracked and the packaging is just fine so it didn’t happen in transit and was sent to us in this condition.Nobody checked the device before it was shipped out because it’s immediately obvious when you pick it up to use it.Her birthday party is on Friday and here we are on Wednesday with a broken phone.We called Amazon and they said the seller has until next Monday to reply to our request for a replacement. Hopefully we hear from them before then with a resolution.We are really sad because she deserves something nice and now we are waiting on the seller to make it right.,Broken. It was supposed to be a B-Day gift for my mom and now she doesn’t get a gift on her Bday,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FSXURCF3VS36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714

Morris did exactly as he promised and I had my terrific new phone before I flew to Texas.Techlobby and Morris provided A+ customer service.  I was and still am very impressed.

United States,true,1120,B07ZPKR714,5.00,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.,Great Savings Good Value,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R5QY4OOZKV9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPKR714
